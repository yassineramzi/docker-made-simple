# Step 1 - Run Your First Container ðŸš€

Letâ€™s start simple with Dockerâ€™s classic test image.

ðŸ‘‰ Run this command in the terminal (on the right):

docker run hello-world

âœ… What happened?
- Docker pulled the `hello-world` image.
- It created a container from that image.
- The container printed a message and then exited.

> **Challenge:** Run it again. Notice how this time Docker didnâ€™t download the image again (it reused the cached layers).
